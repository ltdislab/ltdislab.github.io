      <description>Nexus Group started cooperation with IS Lab in June 2019. Our aim was to identify the needs for Core system in Crypto Gambling Industry. The requirements must have been complete and detailed.
Prior to starting the cooperation with IS Lab we had some doubts if they could study and understand existing system and business processes fully and translate them into common, easily understandable language in given short time. Although soon after starting cooperation high professionalism of IS Lab was evident and all the doubts were annulled.</description>
